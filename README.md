# Credit EDA Project

## 📊 Overview

This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a credit dataset to uncover patterns, detect anomalies, and extract meaningful insights. The dataset includes information about customers’ credit behavior, demographics, and payment history.

## 🧠 Objectives

- Understand the structure and distribution of the credit data
- Identify key features affecting credit risk or approval
- Detect missing values and data imbalances
- Visualize trends using charts and plots
- Support future modeling (optional)

## 🔍 Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle / UCI / Custom CSV]  
- **Records**: ~30,000 entries  
- **Features**: Age, Gender, Credit Score, Payment History, Default Status, etc.

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- plotly (optional)
- jupyter notebook

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rishukumari7250/EDA-project.git
   cd EDA-project

   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
 Launch the notebook:
jupyter notebook Credit_EDA.ipynb

Key Insights
Majority of defaulters fall within the age range of 30–45.

Higher credit scores generally correlate with timely payments.

A small subset of users contributes disproportionately to the total defaults.

Gender and education level have minor influence on default probability.
